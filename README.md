# Technical assignment full-stack engineer

Youâ€™re working on an online shopping platform. The sales team wants to know which items were added to a basket, but removed before checkout. We will use this data later for targeted discounts.

Build a shopping basket that helps you get this data. You are free to use the languages, frameworks and tools you prefer.

**Timing**

You have 1 week to accomplish the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but one of our colleagues tends to say: "Make sure it is good" ;-). Please send us (jobs@madewithlove.com) an email when you are ready with the assignment. Please mention your name, Github username and a link to what we need to review.

## Setup steps

- Clone the repository with __git clone__
- Copy __.env.example__ file to __.env__ and edit database credentials there
- Create a new database, in your DB software (suggested name: `FixForm-Alminko`)
- Import the db file `RootDir\FixForm-Alminko.db` into your MySQL DB software (The file is an SQL type)
- Run __composer install__
- Run __php artisan key:generate__
- (Skip if you imported the SQL DB file) Run __php artisan migrate__
- Run __npm install__
- Run __npm run dev__
- Run __php artisan serve__
- That's it: launch the main URL, ex. __http://127.0.0.1:8000/__
